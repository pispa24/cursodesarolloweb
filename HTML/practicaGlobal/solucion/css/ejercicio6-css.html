    <h2>What is Lorem Ipsum?</h2>
    <hr>
    <section>
      <p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.</p>
      <p>  Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown <br>
        printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book.</P>
        <p>  It has survived not only <span>five centuries,</span> but also the leap into electronic typesetting,<br>
        remaining essentially unchanged.</P>
        <p>  It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets <br>
        containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop <br>
        publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.

    <h3>Why do we use it?</h3>
    <hr>
    <section>
      <p>  It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by <br>
        the readable content of a page when looking at its layout.</p>
        <p> The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal
      <span>distribution of letters,</span>   as opposed to<br> using 'Content here, content 
        here', making it look like readable English.</p>
      <p>   Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use <br>
        Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum'<br>
        will uncover many web sites still in their infancy.</p>
        <p> <span>Various versions</span>  <br>
        have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes <br>
        on purpose (injected humour and the like).</p>
